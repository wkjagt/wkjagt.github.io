This week I wrote [a first post](https://gist.github.com/wkjagt/814b3f62ea03c7b1a765) about the RFID controlled audio book reader I built for my nearly blind grandfather. It got [quite a bit of attention](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8177117) on Hacker News. Many people contacted me asking for more details about how I built it, so I'll be writing a series of posts on how I implemented most parts of it.
